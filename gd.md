## What to Prepare / Focus on for Group Discussion

These are the skills & areas to prepare, plus how to show them with good examples.

| Skill / Area                                      | Why It Matters in a GD                                                                                                                         | How to Show It / Examples                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **General Awareness / Industry Trends**           | They might give a topic related to technology, energy, automation, data/AI, environmental issues. Being aware shows you are informed, curious. | Example: Talk about how oil & gas / energy sector is moving toward automation (e.g. autonomous drilling) and how BI / data analysts can help improve safety and reduce cost. Use recent news: e.g. something about SLB doing autonomous drilling. ([Reuters][1])                                                           |
| **Clear, Structured Thinking**                    | Your points should be logical, not jumbled. Helps you make impact.                                                                             | Use frameworks: “First, define the issue; second, discuss pros/cons; third, summarise / propose solution.” E.g. if topic is “Automation vs Human Workforce,” you might structure as definitions → benefits of each → challenges → your recommendation.                                                                     |
| **Good Communication & Clarity**                  | They evaluate whether you can express ideas clearly, listen, respond.                                                                          | Speak in short sentences, avoid jargon unless needed. If you mention technical BI terms (like “incremental refresh”, “RLS”, “data granularity”), briefly explain for non-technical. Use examples: “In my last project, I reduced report load time by 40% by aggregating sensor data—this saved both time and server cost.” |
| **Active Listening & Building on Others’ Points** | GD is not just about speaking; it's about engaging, being responsive to what others say.                                                       | Example: Someone says “automation may reduce jobs” → you could say “I agree, but as X said, automation also improves safety by reducing human exposure; we must combine automation with re-skilling.” Shows you heard, you respect, you add value.                                                                         |
| **Leadership / Initiative**                       | They look for people who can lead groups, moderate, guide.                                                                                     | Example: If discussion is slowing, suggest, “maybe we should summarise what’s been said and move towards a consensus / conclusion.” Or begin with a relevant definition / opening. Or volunteer to summarise at end.                                                                                                       |
| **Balanced Participation**                        | Don’t dominate; don’t stay silent. Participate meaningfully.                                                                                   | Example: You speak early enough to show initiative, but also leave space for others; when someone else hasn’t spoken, you can say, “I’d like to hear what \[person] thinks about this too,” or “One more viewpoint might be…”                                                                                              |
| **Using Examples / Facts / Data**                 | Makes your arguments credible.                                                                                                                 | Example: Use statistics, real incidents. E.g. “According to X, autonomous drilling increased efficiency by 60%,” or mention real case studies from SLB / oil & gas. Or how decisions in past project (cost savings, downtime reduction) were driven by data.                                                               |
| **Politeness / Respectful Disagreement**          | In GD you’ll likely have differing opinions. How you handle disagreement matters.                                                              | Example: “I see your point, but I disagree because….” or “That’s a good point; however, have you considered …?” Always courteous.                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Conclusion / Summarising**                      | Bringing the discussion to a logical close helps leave a good lasting impression.                                                              | Example: At end you might say, “So summarizing: we have seen pros of automation (efficiency, safety), cons (job displacement, cost). I believe the way forward is hybrid approach + training. Would like to propose that…”                                                                                                 |

## Sample Examples You Should Prepare

Here are examples or stories you can keep ready, to use during GD when relevant:

1. **Project where you used data to make a decision / solve problem**

   * E.g. “In a project, sensor data showed frequent downtimes in certain machines. By analysing patterns, we scheduled preventive maintenance and reduced downtime by X%. This improved output.”

2. **When you led a team or initiative**

   * Even if informal, maybe you coordinated between departments, took lead in a task, or helped teammates. Use that to show leadership.

3. **When you had to compromise / negotiate / find middle ground**

   * E.g. two stakeholders wanted conflicting KPIs; you proposed a compromise measure that balanced both.

4. **Times when you adapted / learned something quickly**

   * E.g. you had to learn a new BI or SQL feature, or manage data under resource constraints.

5. **Knowledge of SLB / Energy / Automation trends**

   * E.g. SLB working on autonomous drilling, sustainability, reducing carbon emissions. How analysts/BI give insight for those.

6. **When you communicated technical info to non-technical people**

   * E.g. you explained dashboards or reports to management, or made a visualization that helped non-tech stakeholders understand.

---

## What to Avoid / Do Carefully

* Dominating the discussion: speak, but let others speak too.
* Going off topic / irrelevant tangents.
* Being overly aggressive or dismissing others’ points.
* Using overly technical language without ensuring everyone (panel / other group members) understands.
* Showing strong biases without considering multiple angles.
